<button class="accordion">Why</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Ronaldo chose football because when he was young he was good at it. He also used to go to school like us. But once an incident happened in which due to some reason his teacher scolds him badly and treated him very disrespectfully so in anger he threw the hair on his teacher. For this, he was removed from the school and was not allowed to take admission to any other school in that particular city or region. Since they were very poor they could not afford to move to some other place and thus his mother told him to continue his career as a footballer as he was good at it and he even liked it . from that moment onwards he took that sport seriously and today he is one the best professional players on the planet. He is also said to be an athlete as when he was in Manchester united he was the fastest man on the earth he was fastest on the ball even faster than Messi you can say.</p>
